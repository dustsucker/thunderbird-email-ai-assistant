  "task_description": "# Enhanced Error Feedback and Notifications\n\nProvide clear, actionable error messages in the UI when API calls fail, models are unavailable, or configuration issues occur. Include notification system for analysis results and errors.\n\n## Rationale\nCurrent limited error feedback leaves users confused when things go wrong. Clear error messages reduce support requests and help users self-diagnose issues with their API keys, rate limits, or network connectivity.\n\n## User Stories\n- As a new user, I want clear error messages so that I can fix configuration problems without searching documentation\n- As a power user, I want to be notified when batch analysis completes so that I don't have to manually check\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] API errors show specific, actionable error messages (not just 'Error')\n- [ ] Rate limit errors suggest waiting time or switching providers\n- [ ] Invalid API key errors guide users to configuration\n- [ ] Network errors distinguish between connectivity and service issues\n- [ ] Optional desktop notifications for analysis completion/failure\n- [ ] Error history log accessible in options page\n",
