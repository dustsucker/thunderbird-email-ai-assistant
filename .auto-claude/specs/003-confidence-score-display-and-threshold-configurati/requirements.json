  "task_description": "# Confidence Score Display and Threshold Configuration\n\nDisplay confidence scores for AI classifications and allow users to configure minimum confidence thresholds. Tags are only applied when confidence exceeds the threshold.\n\n## Rationale\nAddresses market gap-5: lack of transparency in AI decisions. Gmail and SaneBox don't explain why emails are categorized (pain-3-3). Users need to understand AI certainty and control when tags are applied to avoid incorrect classifications.\n\n## User Stories\n- As a cautious user, I want to see confidence scores so that I can understand how certain the AI is about its classifications\n- As a power user, I want to set minimum confidence thresholds so that only high-confidence tags are applied automatically\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Confidence score (0-100%) is displayed alongside each tag suggestion\n- [ ] Global confidence threshold setting in options (default: 70%)\n- [ ] Per-tag confidence threshold override option\n- [ ] Low-confidence classifications are flagged for manual review\n- [ ] Confidence scores are stored with analysis history\n",
